# Grader-Academic
Grader is a web-based frontend application designed to provide an interactive platform for students and educators to view detailed academic information such as admit card, subjects, attendance, class rank, total percentage, recent notices, reminders, and results. This project is intended to simplify the process of tracking academic progress and ensures seamless access to all essential student-related information in one place.

Create a separate folder named as images and move logo.png, profile-1.jpg images to that folder before running the code.
